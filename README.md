# CGProject2019
Repo for project and assignment files for Computer Graphics course 2019

The project, made by 2 people, @Lockyard and @baldasseva consists in a FP demo of a character walking in a dungeon. The focus is on graphics, so techniques to animate object movements and shaders to achieve different effects for different objects, all in WebGL.

The assignments are single-task and individual.
